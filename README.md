# IM-algorithm-for-distributed-HD-QR
This repository provides an R implementation of the IM algorithm introduced in the paper "Communication-Efficient and Distributed-Oracle Estimation for High-Dimensional Quantile Regression".

The Functions/ directory contains the Rcpp implementations of the IM algorithm. Each folder includes codes to reproduce the numerical studies in Sections 4, 5, and Appendix E of the paper.

The United States used cars dataset used in the experiments is available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ananaymital/us-used-cars-dataset.
